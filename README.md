# Milvus for Content Based Image Retrieval for Cats and Dogs

The challenge was to create an end-to-end application scenario using Milvus. 
Using inspiration from David Shvimer's Towards Data Science post (https://towardsdatascience.com/up-and-running-with-milvus-2466161e8b1f), I decided to use Milvus to detect vector similarity for images, primarily that of cats and dogs.

## To Run:
Install Docker

Download data and files and run 'docker-compose' up in root directory
